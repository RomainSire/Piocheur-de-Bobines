## Used technologies
I developped this frontend application with [Angular](https://angular.io/).  
I used the API [The Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) for the backend.  
The application is hosted on [Firebase by Google](https://firebase.google.com/)  

The application successfully passes all unit tests, with a code coverage of 100%.
